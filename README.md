MORE DETAIL 


I am a Final-year student at HCMUTE, my major is Software Engineering and I will become a Fullstack Developer in the future.
I feel curious about everything. So I like to explore everything around me. So I also learned a lot from them. Also, I am very interested in computers. I spend my free time learning programming.
Currently, I am a Web-Mobile Developer, and when I apply to your company, I am looking forward to learning new things and participating in the debate to better understand what I do, what I am doing and what I am aiming for with an energetic and positive working environment of your company's staff.
